This program reads unemployment data from data provided by the FRED Economic Data site, https://fred.stlouisfed.org/. It shows the unemployment rate from 1976 to 2022.
The program analyzes the header and converts date values using the `datetime` class. 
It then plots the national unemployment rate over time with properly labeled axes.
